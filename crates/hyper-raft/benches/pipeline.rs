//! Readies in flight against one at a time (core step R-4, `docs/durable.md`
//! §2.1 and §14.1): three voters, each with a device that flushes one batch
//! at a time and takes every write submitted before the flush began into it
//! (group commit), on a network that delivers each message a fixed one-way
//! time later. Closed-loop clients propose 64-byte entries at the leader
//! and propose again once theirs is applied there. Time is simulated, in
//! microseconds, so the latencies are the protocol's and the devices', not
//! this machine's; the wall time per committed entry is the core's and the
//! harness's CPU.
//!
//! Two devices:
//! - **flush**: a flush answers the writes it holds;
//! - **confirmed**: hyper-log's, where a frame is answered once a later
//!   flush has written its persist record (mantle `docs/design/replica.md`
//!   §3), and a frame nothing follows is confirmed by a flush of its own.
//!
//! On both, a write that asks for no flush (`Ready::must_sync`, a commit
//! alone) is answered with the writes before it and costs none.
//!
//! The times are this machine's, measured: a flush is 4,330 µs, mantle's
//! p50 for an append that waits one `F_FULLFSYNC` on APFS
//! (`docs/measurements/2026-09-29-log-confirmation.md` in mantle), and a
//! one-way trip is half the 395 µs round trip QUIC measured on loopback
//! (`docs/benchmarks.md`, hyper-transport, "An answer is charged with what
//! arrives"). The depths are one, the owner that finishes each write before
//! it takes the next, and two and three, up to hyper-log's three pipeline
//! frames (`docs/durable.md` §6).
