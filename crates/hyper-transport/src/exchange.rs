//! One exchange's state, and the stream reads and writes every exchange and lane is made of.
//!
//! An exchange is one bidirectional QUIC stream: a message each way (node.md §3.2, focal's
//! exchanges). Each message is a prefix, a head and an optional body ([`crate::frame`]). The
//! outgoing message's prefix and head are one contiguous buffer, reserved from the budget and
//! written to QUIC whole when credit allows; its body is written by the owner as it has it. The
//! incoming message's prefix is read into a fixed buffer, its head into a reservation taken only
//! after the prefix's lengths were checked, and its body by the owner, into reservations of its own,
//! so QUIC's flow control holds the sender back while the owner has nowhere to put the bytes.
