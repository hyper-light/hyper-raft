//! What one append and one fetch cost the allocator and the page tables: `cargo bench -p
//! hyper-log --bench allocs [-- DIR]` (docs/benchmarks.md, "Allocations").
//!
//! A log on a real file in DIR (the target directory's scratch by default) takes closed-loop
//! appends from `R` replicas, each to its own group: one round submits one entry for every
//! replica and waits for all of them, so every frame carries the round. The updates are built
//! before the count begins, so the count is the log's own: the submission, the owner's and the
//! device's work, the answer, and the drop of what the log held. The count is the process's,
//! every thread's together (`hyper_measure::alloc::begin_process`), since the log runs threads of
//! its own. Fetches are counted the same way: a group's entries still in memory, the same
//! entries read back from the file after a reopen, a term and a view. The same appends and reads
//! are counted again through each group's handle (`GroupLog`), which keeps its writes' entries
//! and answers its reads itself.
