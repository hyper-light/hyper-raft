//! Waits charged to progress (mantle note 32 T39; focal `transport.rs` `carried` and `frame.rs`
//! `read_payload_arriving`, made sans-io).
//!
//! An exchange is not given a fixed wall time. It is judged once a period, and given up only when
//! a period moved less than a datagram ([`LEAST_PROGRESS`]), so "a megabyte crosses a path of
//! 4 Mbit/s ... between endpoints that give a request one second" (focal 27 §7), and an exchange
//! whose peer stopped taking it ends within a period or two on any path. Two phases:
//!
//! - **Asking**: the request is being carried and the reply's prefix has not arrived. A period is
//!   charged what the connection sent and did not lose in it. The exchange ends at the end of a
//!   period that sent less than a datagram, or in which the peer sent nothing at all, and at the
//!   end of one that began when all the
//!   exchanges on the connection had to send beside it, and its own bytes, had been sent: the peer
//!   had the request and a period to answer it. What was sent is progress only while the peer is
//!   heard: a live peer acknowledges what it receives within its `max_ack_delay` (RFC 9000 §13.2.1,
//!   25 ms by default, §18.2), so a period that heard nothing is silence, and what the sender put
//!   into it (the flight in the air, then the probe timeout's probes, which RFC 9002 §6.2.4 sends
//!   whether or not the peer lives) moved nothing. So a period must be longer than the peer's
//!   acknowledgement delay, and `Endpoint::open` refuses one that is not
//!   (`Refusal::Configuration`); focal's `carried` counted bytes sent alone.
//! - **Answering**: the reply's prefix arrived and its body is arriving (or, on the side that
//!   answers, the request is arriving). A period must bring a datagram's worth of the connection's
//!   received bytes, or the body's end. Its bytes may come after others the peer sends first: what
//!   a more urgent class has to send (strict priority, T15), and what the peer declared on the
//!   connection's other exchanges of its class or a less urgent one. So the wait is charged with
//!   the bytes of its own class and the less urgent ones that the connection delivered, against
//!   what the peer declared and has still to deliver of them, this body included; the body ends at
//!   the end of a period that began with all of that delivered, as the asking phase ends one that
//!   began with everything sent. A peer that withholds the body while it sends others is given up
//!   once it has sent everything it owed; one that sends nothing, within a period.
//!
//!   The wait used to be bounded instead by the body's residency, its bytes at two datagrams of
//!   the least size a round trip of the path (focal `frame.rs`), and a period at least. That prices
//!   a sender limited by its path alone, which holds where a payload is written whole before it is
//!   sent and has its stream to itself. Here the peer's owner writes the body as it has it, its
//!   exchanges share the connection, and both ends may be short of CPU, so the round trip QUIC
//!   measures (395 µs on loopback) says nothing of when the body ends: an 8 MiB bulk reply moving
//!   at 2.7 MB/s was refused at 5.5 MB read (windows-11-arm, 35d35d8), and a 64 KiB reply queued
//!   behind fifteen others at none read while its period brought 464 KB. A wall-clock bound
//!   measures the machine, not the peer (`hyper_timing::progress`); what a slow body holds here is
//!   bounded in bytes by the receive window the budget funds, not by time.
