//! SWIM between real processes over the sealed datagram plane on real UDP sockets: the usage
//! mantle, focal and slates make of it.
//!
//! The supervisor (`a_killed_member_is_declared_dead_by_every_survivor_and_no_live_one_is`)
//! starts `NODES` copies of this test binary as member processes (`member_process`, selected by
//! `HYPER_SWIM_NODE`). Each runs the detector as the library configures it: it polls when the
//! detector asks, sends what the detector returns (its probes, the answers, and the chunks of its
//! view its anti-entropy exchanges ask), and prints, every period, its record since the last (its
//! probes, asks, answers and findings, [`Record`]) and a line of its view, the detection bound its
//! detector states and what it reports of each peer. The test measures nothing of its own and
//! derives no bound. The supervisor waits on facts, each for as long as the members
//! move toward it: a quiet period derived from what they state (the longest detection bound a live
//! member states, never less than RFC 6298's one-second retransmission timeout) that passes with
//! nothing moving fails the wait with every member's last line, and so does a pair that takes more
//! round trips without its own configuration than any window of its estimator holds
//! (`hyper_timing::WINDOW_LIMIT`), or a member whose output ends, its process exited, unless the
//! supervisor killed it. In two phases:
//! - every member judges every peer by a configured verdict, the pair's own or, while the pair's
//!   estimator refuses, the pool's; then it SIGKILLs one member ([`POOLED`]), which within a few
//!   hundred milliseconds of the start is judged mostly by the pools;
//! - every survivor reports it dead; then the run goes on until every surviving pair is judged by
//!   its own estimator, and the supervisor SIGKILLs another ([`OWNED`]);
//! - every survivor reports that one dead too. Each survivor holds each victim dead within the
//!   detection bound its detector stated, with the wait it measured for evidence of its own health
//!   added where its condemnation was pending on it.
//!
//! What it asserts of every suspicion and condemnation is the detector's rule, exactly, from the
//! members' own records (`docs/timing.md` §2.7). Each member records every probe it sends, with the
//! deadline its detector stated as it was sent, every ping-request, every answer it hands its
//! detector, every ping it answers, and what each poll found ([`Detector::findings`]). Each
//! suspicion, and each condemnation made pending, is traced to its probe: sent when the finding
//! says, with the deadline it states; its period ended no earlier than that deadline nor, where
//! relays were asked, than theirs; no answer, direct or relayed, handed to the detector before the
//! end. Then to the answer that missed it, handed over late, or was lost, the target's record
//! saying whether the ping reached it. Each condemnation is traced to the pending one it follows
//! and to the answer from another member it was made at, and every count a member reports is its
//! findings'. Theorem 7's allowance for live members, `Σβ` over every judged probe, is printed
//! beside their counts: a report, not a test, for a count is what the rule found, not a draw.
