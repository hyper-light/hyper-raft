//! The application layer over hyper-quic, sans-io (mantle note 32 §3.4, step T-1).
//!
//! mantle's application protocol in slates' shape (node.md §3): one connection per peer,
//! bidirectional exchanges of a request and a reply, classes with a credit reserve for the classes
//! above, absolute credits, typed refusals, streaming bodies through reservations, and the class
//! decided by the message's kind and the sender's role, never by anything a peer chooses. Its
//! generic core is focal-wire's (`transport.rs`, `peers.rs`, `admission.rs`, `frame.rs`,
//! `round.rs`), ported from an async crate over quinn into a state machine over hyper-quic
//! (`ORIGIN.md`).
//!
//! The [`Endpoint`] owns hyper-quic's endpoint and every connection, and is driven by its caller:
//! it is fed `now`, datagrams and timeouts, and it returns datagrams, a timeout and [`Event`]s. It
//! never spawns, never reads a clock and never opens a socket.
//!
//! What a project supplies:
//! - [`Classes`]: its message kinds, the class each sender role gives each kind, and each class's
//!   frame bound;
//! - [`Budget`]: the bytes the node may hold for the transport, over its own accountant;
//! - [`Directory`]: which peer, in which role, a certificate names.
