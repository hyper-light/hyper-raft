//! The congestion controllers hyper-quic runs, measured beside one another on hyper-sim's network
//! (`docs/transport.md` §4d): focal's F39 grids, ported.
//!
//! Real hyper-quic endpoints (TLS 1.3, packet protection, loss recovery, pacing) exchange over
//! hyper-sim's network in virtual time. Each flow is a client node and a server node, and every
//! flow's datagrams cross one bottleneck link each way, the dumbbell of RFC 5166: a stated rate, a
//! queue of one bandwidth-delay product, drop-tail or managed, the IP header's ECN field carried.
//! Each client sends one transfer as fast as its law lets it, from the run's start to its end.
//!
//! A run is its seed's: the world orders every arrival and timer, no path draws, and the endpoints'
//! own keys and nonces change no size and no time, so each check is exact for the seeds it names,
//! and the run-twice check (`docs/sim.md` §3.9) holds the harness to that.
//!
//! The gate runs one path for a few seconds. focal's grid, thirty seconds a run, is a measurement run
//! by hand (`--ignored`), and is what `docs/benchmarks.md` records.
