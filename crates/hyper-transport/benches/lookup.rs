//! What a stream event costs as a connection's open exchanges grow: one exchange, request and
//! reply of a small body, timed and its allocations counted while `n` other exchanges stay open
//! and idle on the same connection, for `n` doubling from 1, then the limit itself: `WIDE` less the
//! timed exchange, the most the connection's exchange limit lets stay open beside it. The peer's
//! concurrent-stream credit is `WIDE` too, so credit never binds and every exchange holds a
//! stream: the bench times the scheduling core, not waiting for credit. Every Readable, Writable
//! and Stopped event of the timed exchange is matched to its exchange (`exchange_on`); a scan of
//! the connection's exchanges made that grow with `n`.
//! `cargo bench -p hyper-transport --bench lookup` (docs/benchmarks.md, "Exchange lookup by stream").
