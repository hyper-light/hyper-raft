//! What liveness costs a node, per second, for `G` groups over `P` peers: the node-pair stream
//! against what each project runs today. `cargo bench -p hyper-liveness --bench cost`
//! (docs/benchmarks.md, "hyper-liveness").
//!
//! - **The node-pair stream** (this crate): `P + 1` nodes, every pair sharing groups, on the
//!   simulated clock of `world.rs`; messages and the time spent in the crate's calls, per heartbeat
//!   sent or taken, measured.
//! - **Per-group heartbeats** (mantle's and focal's today): the Raft core they run (this
//!   repository's `hyper-raft`, which mantle vendors and into which focal's core changes are
//!   ported), with focal's `election_tick` 10 and `heartbeat_tick` 2 (`focal-consensus`'s defaults;
//!   mantle's range settings have the same shape). `G` groups a node of three voters each, placed
//!   round robin over the `P + 1` nodes, every group with a leader and nothing to replicate; every
//!   member ticks, every leader heartbeats its followers and they answer. Messages and the time of
//!   the ticks, the readies and the deliveries, per tick, measured.
//! - **slates' detector** (`hyper-swim`, slates' SWIM conformed): `P + 1` members, each probing one
//!   peer a period; messages and the time a period, measured.
//!
//! Per second, each is put at the same interval `η` between heartbeats on a pair (a group's
//! `heartbeat_tick` ticks; a SWIM member's round of `P` periods), so each detects as fast: the
//! interval the configurator chose on the macOS trace at 100 µs, 50 ms (`docs/timing.md` §2.6).
