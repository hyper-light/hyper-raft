//! The decision tape: every word a run's schedule drew, grouped by the step that drew it, so a run
//! is replayed, mutated and shrunk by its tape (`docs/sim.md` §3.1, "The decision trace"; §4.5,
//! coverage-guided mutation and shrinking).
//!
//! A harness draws through a [`Player`]: each word comes from the tape being played while its step
//! has words left, and from a filler stream (SplitMix64 from a stated seed) once it has none; every
//! word the run took is recorded, step by step, into the tape it gives back ([`Player::finish`]).
//! A step's words are read as the harness reads any draw, reduced to the bound it asks for, so
//! **any tape is a feasible schedule**: a word moved, dropped or redrawn is read against whatever
//! the state then offers. That is what Gulcan et al. (§3.2, "feasible mutation") get by naming
//! buffers rather than messages; here it holds of every decision, not only deliveries. The tape a
//! run gives back replays it exactly: each step reads the words it took, no more, no fewer.
//!
//! Each step carries a kind the harness names (a delivery, a crash, any other operation), which
//! the mutations of [`Tape::mutate`] respect, and its length is bounded ([`Bounds`]): a tape that
//! would pass its bound is refused ([`TapeError::Full`]).
