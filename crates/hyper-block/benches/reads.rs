//! A seek's page reads, one after another or as one batch through the device's issuer:
//! `cargo bench -p hyper-block --bench reads [-- DIR]` (docs/benchmarks.md, "hyper-block: a
//! batch of reads through the issuer").
//!
//! A file of pages on a real disk in DIR (the target directory's scratch by default), opened for
//! direct I/O where the file system takes it, so a read reaches the device rather than the page
//! cache. Each operation reads `FAN_OUT` pages at pseudo-random page offsets, the pages an engine's
//! seek reads from as many branches. **sequential** reads them on the calling thread, one
//! `read_exact_at` after another. **batched** hands them to an issuer of `FAN_OUT` workers as one
//! batch (`Attached::submit_reads`) and takes its answer. The buffers are the same each operation and
//! go back to the caller with the answer, so the count is the read path's own.
//!
//! Each row takes Wilks' least sample for a one-sided 95 % bound on the p99.9, `n = ⌈ln 0.05 / ln
//! 0.999⌉ = 2,995` operations [WILKS], after as many unmeasured. Allocator calls are counted across
//! the process, the issuer's threads included (`hyper_measure::alloc::begin_process`), and page
//! faults from the OS (`hyper_measure::faults`), each per operation.
