//! Replication lanes (node.md §3.2; mantle note 32 T37, T38).
//!
//! Replication messages from one shard to one peer travel on one long-lived stream, so their order
//! is kept and the stream count does not grow with ranges. A lane is a unidirectional stream that
//! opens with its identifier and then carries frames, each a prefix and its bytes ([`crate::frame`];
//! a frame is a message with no body). A lane's queue is as wide as the core's window (T37): a core
//! that keeps its own window never finds its lane full, and one that does not is refused, typed.
//! A lane is always read: a frame whose class bound or budget cannot take it is skipped and
//! counted, as the replica already refuses what it cannot hold, so one full range never stalls the
//! stream for its shard.
