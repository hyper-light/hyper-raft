//! Credits (node.md §3.3; mantle note 32 T16, T17, T33).
//!
//! QUIC's flow control is limit-based and quinn keeps one window per connection, so what a node
//! buffers for a peer is bounded by that connection's receive window, and the classes share it.
//! Three rules are kept here, each derived:
//!
//! - **The class reserve** (slates `connection.rs`, `class_credit_reserve`): a class leaves unspent
//!   one packet's stream bytes of the peer's connection credit for every class above it, so the
//!   first packet of a more urgent exchange finds credit waiting however much the classes below
//!   have queued. slates measured a control ping waiting 68 ms of a 40 ms path for credit a bulk
//!   stream had taken, before its reserve. The receiver advertises the largest reserve on top of
//!   its window, so the reserve is headroom, never a cut.
//! - **The window** starts at RFC 9002's initial congestion window, so the receiver never holds a
//!   new sender below what its controller may already send, and doubles whenever the application
//!   consumed a whole window in less than two round trips, the sign that the window and not the path
//!   limited the transfer (Chromium QUIC's `QuicFlowController::MaybeIncreaseMaxWindowSize`, slates
//!   `flow.rs`). Each growth is reserved from the node's budget first, so the window is
//!   `min(BDP, share)`: it follows the path's bandwidth-delay product while the budget funds it.
//! - **The stream window's ceiling** is quinn's 1,024-span assembler limit made explicit (patch Q5):
//!   a window `W` of frames of at least `d` bytes is left with at most `W / (2d)` spans when every
//!   other frame is lost, so a window of at most `2 · 1,024 · d` cannot close the connection with
//!   "too many gaps in stream buffer" (node.md §3.3; focal reached the limit with a 10 MiB window).
