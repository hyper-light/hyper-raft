//! hyper-swim's first simulation (`docs/sim.md` §9, step S-2): the cluster test's members on
//! hyper-sim's world and network instead of processes and sockets.
//!
//! Five members, each with a clock of its own (an offset, a rate within RFC 5905's 15 ppm, timers
//! late by a drawn amount), send their messages encoded as on the plane, carried by the network's
//! LAN path, each arrival an event of the world. Once every member judges every peer by a verdict
//! (the pair's own or the pool's), one member is killed: its arrivals are dropped and its timer
//! disarmed. Every survivor then holds it dead within the detection bound its detector stated, with
//! the wait it measured for evidence of its own health added where its condemnation was pending on
//! it, and no member holds a live one dead. Every seed's run replays from its seed, so each check
//! is exact for the seeds named; the run-twice check refuses a run whose digests differ.
//!
//! The far-link runs (`docs/timing.md` §2.7, "A pair the pool does not fit") put some members 100 ms one way from the rest
//! ([`Shape`]), each pair joined with its handshake's round trip as slates' daemons join: a pair the
//! pooled verdict does not fit is never judged by it, is judged by its own timer until its own
//! estimator configures, and a member that dies before any far pair configured is still condemned
//! by every survivor within the bound its detector stated.
