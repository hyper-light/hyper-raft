//! The exchange table and its running sums: what each connection's exchanges have to send and
//! are owed, kept as the exchanges change rather than folded over all of them when read.
//!
//! The scheduling core asks three sums on every operation: what the classes above a rank still
//! have to send (`demand_above`, which a class's credit is shared against), what the connection's
//! exchanges hold unsent (`held`, the asking wait's charge), and what the peer has declared and not
//! delivered of a rank and the less urgent ones (`backlog`, the answering wait's charge). Each was
//! a fold over every exchange on the connection, and the core asks them for each exchange it
//! visits, so one operation cost O(n²) in the connection's open exchanges: 5.0 µs beside one open
//! exchange, 55.5 ms beside 1,023 (hyper-transport `benches/lookup.rs`, docs/benchmarks.md,
//! 2026-10-05).
//!
//! Here each exchange carries the share it was last counted with ([`Counted`]), and each
//! connection's [`Tally`] holds the sums of those shares by rank. Any mutable access to an
//! exchange through the [`Table`] marks it touched; [`Table::settle`] recounts the touched ones,
//! moving each one's old share out of its connection's tally and its new share in; a removed
//! exchange's share leaves with it. No mutation site has to remember to update a sum, so none can
//! be missed: what is not touched cannot have changed. A read after a settle is exact: the sums are
//! held in `u128` and clamped to `u64` when read, which is what the saturating fold gave
//! (every share is non-negative, so the fold saturates exactly when the true sum passes `u64`).
//!
//! The touched list holds each live exchange at most once (its `touched` flag), and the table
//! settles itself before the list would pass its capacity, so it never grows past the exchange
//! bound. With the `oracle` feature, an endpoint switched to it compares every settled tally with
//! the folds it replaced and counts any difference (`Endpoint::oracle_mismatches`); the
//! test harness switches every endpoint it builds to it.
