//! hyper-quic at a geographic distance: 500 ms one way, the owner's test condition (hyper-sim's
//! `Path::GEOGRAPHIC` mean), on hyper-sim's network in virtual time.
//!
//! A client and a server endpoint, real TLS 1.3 with the hybrid post-quantum key exchange the
//! client offers first (SecP384r1MLKEM1024, a 1,665-byte key share that puts the ClientHello in two
//! Initial datagrams), exchange over one path each way. Every datagram either side sends is
//! recorded with its time and its first packet's type, so a test reads the handshake's schedule
//! off the record and checks it exactly against the RFCs' arithmetic.
//!
//! A run is its seed's: the world orders every arrival and timer, and the endpoints' keys and
//! nonces change no size and no time (Ed25519 signatures are always 64 bytes, RFC 8032 §5.1.6;
//! ML-KEM-768's encapsulation key and ciphertext are fixed sizes, FIPS 203 Table 3), so each check
