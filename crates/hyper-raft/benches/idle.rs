//! What an idle group costs its owner, on ticks and by suspicion (timing
//! step L-2, `docs/timing.md` §2.9). Many groups of three voters, all in this
//! process, each elected and holding one committed entry, every member caught
//! up; then the owner's periods pass with nothing proposed.
//!
//! - **ticks**: each period the owner ticks every member of every group, as
//!   raft-rs's owners do, takes what each member gives, and delivers every
//!   message within the group until it is quiet: the leader's heartbeats
//!   every `heartbeat_tick` periods and their answers.
//! - **suspicion**: each period the owner asks every member of every group
//!   when it is next to be woken (`RawNode::deadline`), the most an owner
//!   without a timer queue would do, and wakes none, for none is due.
//!   An owner that keeps its deadlines in a timer queue does nothing at all.
//!
//! `idle <ticks|suspicion> <groups> <periods>` runs one, for a process
//! measurement (`/usr/bin/time -l`); with no arguments both run at 10,000
//! groups and 200 periods. It prints the time a period took, a group, and
//! the messages a period sent.
